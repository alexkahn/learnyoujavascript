# Learn you JavaScript for fun and profit
JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript, a standardized browser scripting language that powers all aspects of the WWW. What exactly does JavaScript do? It adds behavior to web pages, it allows you to do things asyncronously, it allows you to store things on the client, in short: JavaScript allows you to program the web.

What are all these JavaScript buzz words?
- Node: a stand-alone (no browser) JavaScript interpreter (things that runs your code) built out of Chrome. It's wicked fast and built to do things asyncronously.
What is JQuery?
- JQuery is a library (a bunch of files with code in them like yours) that turns ugly, annoying JavaScript into nice, elegant JavaScript.
ex: $('.my-class')
is the equivalent of:
 
## Programming Principles
- KISS
- DRY
- Convention over Configuration
- YouAintGonnaNeedIt
- Horses for Courses (HFC)
- Typing is BAD -> Keyboard Shortcuts
- Mouses are BAD

## Data
Here we want to start off with things that describe data. The world is all information and we can represent it in many ways but some ways are more sensible then others **but** HFC.

### Strings
- '' vs ""
- Methods and Operators for Strings

### Numbers
- NaN
- Integers
- Floats

### Arrays
- Ordered list of arbitrary data
### Objects
### Boolean
### Dates
### Undefined
### Null

typeof
instanceof

isNaN

Constructs
- Statements
	- Control Flow
		- if
		- if else
		- ?
		- if elseif else
		- switch
	- Loops
		- for
			- (var i = 0; i < something; i++)
			- (banana in bunch)
		- while
			- INFINITE LOOPS!!
- Expressions
- Functions

Higher Level Ideas
- OOP
- Event driven programming
- Designing Code


Demo:
putting it all together:
A Practical Example with a Real-World problem (that you can SOLVE!)
- Simple website for collecting email addresses
- Stores them in a spreadsheet?
- Displays a landing page and sends a pop-up based on cookies
