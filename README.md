# Hello There!
Welcome to my little repo of JavaScript learning materials. There isn't
much here yet as I build up the basics but feel free to read to and
contribute - just fork and make a pull request when you're ready.

**Note** The tone and scope of this small project is to get people with
no programming experience up to speed with JavaScript with a minimal
amount of detail. Here, I define minimal to mean the fewest details
possible to both understand a concept and feel confident in applying it. If you wish to contribute, please keep that in mind.

## Manifest
1. Learn you JavaScript for fun and profit
    The first guide meant to introduce primative types and refence types
2. Code Examples (non existant yet)
    A directory of example code from production environments as reading
examples so new people can see what this stuff looks like in the wild
but with a boat load of extra comments and asides.
