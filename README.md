# Hello There!

One day some people needed to learn JavaScript and weren't getting what they needed to do so. I decided I would jump in and help. They liked what they heard so I figured that I would attempt to write it down.

**Note** The tone and scope of this small project is to get people with
no programming experience up to speed with JavaScript with a minimal
amount of detail. Here, I define minimal to mean the fewest details
possible to both understand a concept and feel confident in applying it. If you wish to contribute, please keep that in mind.
