### Functions

Functions are a way of holding on to a piece of logic. It is a way of
making a new, reusable procedure. The real power of these things is
their flexibility so we'll start small and move up.

```js
function hello () {
  alert('Hello');
}
```

Here we used the `function` key word to name a procedure `hello`. We can
'call' that procedure like so:

```js
hello();
```

This isn't a particularly useful function but as you can see, we can
make our functions call other functions, thus combining procedures we
would often have to do repeatedly.

Consider the very code we looked it in this tutorial. We looked at what
jQuery does for all that JavaScript. jQuery creates objects that refer
to DOM elements which allow us to call simple looking methods that make
all the extra code none of our concern.
